* Genres:
  * 1950s, Doo-Wop, Rockabilly, Motown, Blues, Swing, Soul, Jazz, Rock and roll
* Add at the beginning `[Instrumental solo]`
  * Without it song may start too abruptly
* Better short lines (4-8 words)
* Add `[Chorus]` and `[Verse]` to help AI understand structure of a song
* Better if structure of song and bars is uniform (e.g. bad if some lines are long while other are short)
* Usually makes sense to remove text in parenthesis:
