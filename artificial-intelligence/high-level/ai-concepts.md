### AI concepts
* `Vibe coding` - LLM generates code, while programmer guides, tests, reviews and refines
* `MCP` (Model Context Protocol) - protocol that standardizes how apps provide context to LLM (e.g. previous messages and data from relevant websites)
* `RAG` (Retrieval-augmented generation) - allows LLMs to incorporate new info in context
    * E.g. read relevant books/web pages before answering user request
* `Model distillation` - knowledge transfer from large & expensive model (teacher) to a small & cheap one (student)
* `AI Agent` - AI that acts autonomously
* Structured output - instruct model to provide responses in very specific JSON format (so it can function as a typical backend service)
* Smarter AI system = more model parameters + more data + more compute resources
