### AI concepts
* `Vibe coding` - LLM generates code, while programmer guides, tests, reviews and refines
* `MCP` (Model Context Protocol) - allows LLM to use external tools, services and data sources (like USB port for AI)
  * Examples - access to filesystem, docker, git, database, browser etc
* `RAG` (Retrieval-augmented generation) - allows LLMs to incorporate new info in context
    * E.g. read relevant books/web pages before answering user request
* `Model distillation` - knowledge transfer from large & expensive model (teacher) to a small & cheap one (student)
* `AI Agent` - AI that acts autonomously
* `BYOM` - Bring your own model (tool can use any OpenAI compatible API, just insert API URL + Token)
* `Skill` - Explains to LLM how to do something (detailed description in english, often has links to documentation or scripts to run)
  * E.g. how to download video, how to write jokes, how to edit pdf
* Structured output - instruct model to provide responses in very specific JSON format (so it can function as a typical backend service)
* Smarter AI system = more model parameters + more data + more compute resources
