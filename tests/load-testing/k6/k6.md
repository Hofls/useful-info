### Getting started
* Download & install k6 studio - https://github.com/grafana/k6-studio/releases
* New recording -> Click around the website (will record all http requests & browser events (clicks/button presses))
* To generate & run script with http requests only: 
  * Recordings -> Pick recent recording -> Create test -> HTTP test -> Validate Script -> Export script
* To generate & run script with browser events only (clicks/button presses):
  * Recordings -> Pick recent recording -> Create test -> Browser test -> Validate script
* Download & install k6 (cli) - https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases
* Run script exactly 1 time (for validation):
  * `k6 run http-script.js --iterations 1`
* To run script via cli in 2 parallel threads (2 virtual users), for 10 seconds:
  * `k6 run http-script.js --vus 2 --duration 10s`

### Minimal template
```
import { sleep } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://example.com');
  sleep(1);  
}
```

### Known bugs
* If test has options, then you cant use cli parameters like `--iterations` or `--vus` (they will override everything). Gotta set options directly:
```
export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    default: {
      executor: "shared-iterations",
	  vus: 1,
      iterations: 1,
      options: { browser: { type: "chromium" } },
    },
  },
};
```
