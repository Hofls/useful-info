### Graphic design
* `Graphic design` - uses visuals to convey a message
* Keep it simple. Too much stuff becomes overwhelming for a viewer
* Important goal - transmit information to a viewer as quickly as possible 
    * e.g. 2 second glance should be enough

##### Fundamentals
* `Line` - shape that connects two or more points
    * Usage:
        * Add emphasis to a word (underscore)
        * Divide or organize content (left side | right side)
        * Guide the viewer (arrows on a schema)
    * Attributes:
        * Weight (e.g. thin - less important, thick - more important)
        * Color (e.g. green - OK, red - FAIL)
        * Texture (e.g. solid - formal, patch - informal)
        * Style (straight / curvy)
* `Shape` - 2D area with a boundary (e.g. square, heart, star...)
    * Usage:
        * Organize/Separate content (e.g. left half - yellow rectangle, right half - grey)
        * Simple illustrations (e.g. rectangle cup with square ice and circle lemon)
        * 
* `Form` - 3D shape (even illusion of depth is enough)
    * Usage:
        * Light, shadow and perspective contribute to realism
        * 
* `Texture` - physical quality of a surface
    * Usage:
        * Adds depth and tactility to otherwise flat images
        * Great background images
        * Can be smooth, rough, hard or soft
* `Balance` - equal distribution of visual weight
    * Affected by color, size, number and negative space
    * Symmetrical - similar on both sides (e.g. centered)
    * Asymmetrical - sides are different but have the same weight (e.g. image on the left, text on the right)
    
##### Brand & Identity
* `Brand` - distinct identity of a company (name, logo, design, theme, mission, story)
    * `Visual identity` - how brand looks like (logo, color palette, typography)
* `Style guide` - set of standards
    
##### Typography
* `Typography` - style of text
* `Fonts`:
    * Serif - classic, traditional
    * Sans Serif - clean and modern
* `Display fonts` - decorative, for a small amount of text (e.g. headers)
    * Gang of Three - asian style
    * Old london - medieval
    * Square one - techno

##### Color
* `Color palette` - primary and secondary colors used in design
    * Usually primary colors derived from company logo
* Bright colors - fun and modern
* Desaturated colors - business-like
* Color psychology:
    * Black - power, professional, accuracy
    * Grey - balance, neutral, calm
    * Green - nature, growth, health
    * Yellow - optimism, energetic, fun
    * Orange - warm, impulse
    * Red - brave, ambition, danger, anger, love
    * White - pure, sincere
    * Blue - masculine, trust, strength
    * Pink - feminine, fun, sweet

##### Other elements
* `Layout/Composition` - arrangement of visual elements
    * `Proximity` - related elements grouped together, groups should be separated
        * On a business card - name and speciality; phone number and email; skills and qualifications
    * `White space` - negative space (space between content, lines and margins)
    * `Alignment` - lining up elements (left side, center, right side)
    * `Contrast` - difference between items
        * e.g. between a header and body: black and white, thick and thin, serif and sans serif
    * `Repetition` - reinforce design by reusing same elements
* `Hierarchy` - show the importance of elements by manipulating size, color, background, position etc
    * Most important parts should stand out from the rest (e.g. slogan, buy/try/proceed button)
* `Flow` - movement and direction (leading an eye from one part to another)
* `Harmony` - combination of similar or related elements (adjacent colors, shapes, texture)
* `Focal point` - point of interest, focus (draws attention)
* `Function` - consideration of main objective, does design reached the goal? (e.g. make viewer interested in a product)

##### Design checklist
* Check balance, proximity, alignment, flow, harmony, font
* Is main colors are good fit for the message?
* Check hierarchy, contrast
    * Highlight using existing color scheme
* If left with big chunks of nothing - think about filling them with shapes
* Simplify - remove small and unnecessary details
* Test - show different designs to target audience, see how they react
