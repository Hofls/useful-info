### Definitions

    * `Availability` - shortcut to estimate probability of events on the basis of how easy it is to think of examples
    * `Substitution` - substitution of difficult question with a simple one
    * `Framing` - context in which choices presented
        * Surgery survival rate - 90%, people accept. Surgery death rate - 10%, people deny.
    * `Overconfidence` - people often overestimate how much they understand about the world, underestimate role of chance

### Ideas
* 2 systems:
    * Automatic, emotional, impulsive, quick, cheap and simple
    * Conscious, logical, slow, expensive and complex
* Solving complicated problems takes mental work, so our brain cuts corners when we're tired or stressed
* Make important decisions only with conscious system
