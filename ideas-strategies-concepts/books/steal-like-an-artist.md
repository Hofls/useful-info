TLDR - learn from work of others, remix and reimagine

### Definitions
* `Steal` - learn and take inspiration from work of other people

### Ideas
* Produce content you want to consume (e.g. blog about stuff that interests you)
* Do good work and share it with people (e.g. post about your game on reddit)
* Thanks to internet - you learn from anyone, be inspired by anyone
* Donâ€™t steal just style, steal the thinking behind the style
* Side Projects And Hobbies Are Important
    * Practice productive procrastination
    * Have a lot of projects going at once. Got tired from one project? Move to another
* Be Nice - Make Friends, Ignore Enemies (on the internet)
* Good theft - (honor, don't degrade) (study, don't skim) (steal from many, not from one) 
    * (credit, don't plagiarize) (transform, dont imitate) (remix, dont rip off)
* Move closer to goals every day (habits)
