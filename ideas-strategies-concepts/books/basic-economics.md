### TLDR
* TLDR - libertarian perspective on economics

### Definitions
* `Economics` - study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses

### Ideas
* In Economic decisions - intentions and goals mean nothing, incentives and consequences mean everything
* People tend to act in self-interest. To maximize productivity - company and employee should have aligned motivations.
    * E.g. The more products company produces - the more money it gets. Employee compensation should depend on an amount of quality products he produces.
* Price ceiling causes high demand and low supply. Price floor causes low demand and high supply.
* If legal market is too regulated (price restrictions, very high taxes) - black market emerges
* People tend to explain economic outcomes by greed, exploitation, discrimination
    * E.g. shop in low-income neighborhood has high prices to offset damage from crime (and not because of some conspiracy)
* Companies compete with each other, trying to provide the best goods/services for lowest prices. Customers win.
* Companies are being created and liquidated all the time, but economy only getting stronger. (Antifragile)
* Losses are very important - they force companies to change and adapt.
* Minimum wage laws make some jobs unprofitable for buisness, effectively removing them.
* Unions artificially raise wages, thus reducing labor demanded at that high price.
* People and businesses should specialize in what they do best to maximize their productivity.
* Very high taxes can discourage work, saving, and investment
