TLDR - about genes and evolution

### Ideas
* All started when `first replicator` appeared (out of random chemical reactions in primordial soup)
    * Some replications contained errors (`mutations`). Replicas with bad traits die off, with good traits - continue (`evolution`)
* `Selfish gene` - means it's evolved to care about the only thing - it's survival.
    * If survival for genes means jumping from one survival machine (people) to another (through procreation) - so be it
    * Explains why family help each other, infanticide (Zoology)
* If some behavior/trait persisted through evolution - it's very likely to give an advantage (to survival/reproduction)
* Most animal species have 2 sexes because it allows fast spread of beneficial traits (genes) on population
    * With pure self-replication there is no way to get those traits from another specimen
* `Prisoners dilemma` winning strategy - tit-for-tat
    * Start by cooperation, then mirror each move of other player
    * It means cooperation happens because it increases chances of survival/reproduction
* Gene - unit of genetic information. `Meme` - unit of cultural information.
    * They share a lot of similarities (memes evolve, mutate, replicate, compete, die)
    * Memes live in human brain (neural connections), but can be stored anywhere (e.g. in a book)
    * Genetic evolution applies to humans and other animals. While cultural evolution unique to humans
    * Concept of altruism comes from a meme, and not from a gene
