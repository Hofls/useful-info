TLDR - to build an addictive product - create a cycle (trigger -> action -> variable reward -> investment)

### Ideas
* Trigger - stimuli that prompt user to take action 
    * External - e.g. app notification
    * Internal - e.g. feeling of boredom
* Action - behavior in response to trigger (e.g. playing a round in a game)
* Variable reward - random reward (makes user anticipate big reward)
* Investment - user invests something in the product (e.g. time, data, money)
