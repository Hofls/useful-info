### TLDR
* Design of everyday things - product design, user experience and human-computer interaction

### Definitions
* `Affordances` - ways in which an object's physical characteristics communicate its function to the user
* `Feedback` - information a product provides to the user about the results of their actions
* `Constraints` - limitations and boundaries that guide user behavior
* `Signifiers` - elements that indicate the function of a product or control
* `Discoverability` - ease with which a user can learn how to use a product
* `Feature creep` - product keeps adding new features, which leads to high complexity

### Ideas
* It's important to forgive user errors
