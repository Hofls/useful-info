TLDR - how to build and maintain habits

### Definitions
* `Habit` - routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously
* `Habit loop`
    * `Cue` - signal for possible reward (cigarette pack)
    * `Craving` - desire to get reward (desire to get that "hit")
    * `Response` - action you take to get reward (smoking cigarette)
    * `Reward` - satisfying feeling

### Ideas
* Small `improvements accumulate` over time into remarkable results
    * Increase productivity, knowledge, relationships quality
    * Decrease stress, negative thoughts
* Set `goals`, create `systems` to achieve them (System = plan)
* Measure progress (metrics), 
    * It's nice to see good graphic go up / bad go down
* To create a `good habit`:
    * `Cue` - make habit obvious
        * To eat a healthy food - make it stand out
        * Create associations - brush teeth after waking up, go to gym after work
    * `Craving` - make habit attractive
        * Instead of thinking "I need to run" think "I need to build endurance to win a marathon"
    * `Response` - make habit easy
        * Break complex tasks into simple ones
        * Start with small goals, increase them over time
        * To quit smoking - decrease your cigarette count gradually over time
    * `Reward` - make habit satisfying
        * Cross it from todo list, show-off your new skill to other people, think how you just get closer to the goal
* To break a `bad habit`:
    * `Cue` - make habit invisible
        * To quit playing game - remove shortcut from desktop
    * `Craving` - make habit unattractive
        * Instead of thinking "I need to quit smoking" think "I need to maintain good health, prevent bad smell, save money"
    * `Response` - make habit difficult
        * To quit smoking - prohibit yourself from smoking in the nearside room, go all the way out of the building
    * `Reward` - make habit unsatisfying
        * Think about short and long term consequences, make it visible to other people
