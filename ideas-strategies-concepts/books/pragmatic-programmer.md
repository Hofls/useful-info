### TLDR
* Pragmatic programmer - how to become a better programmer

### Ideas
* Be a catalyst for change (show better ways to do things)
* Make learning a habit (keep up with times)
* Remember to look at the big picture
* Critically analyze information
* Communicate effectively (e.g. without confrontation and toxicity)
* Create prototypes to learn (e.g. can this architecture handle 1k requests per second?)
* Design and code in your user's language (DDD)
* Test everything (automatically, e.g. unit tests)
* Work with users (gather feedback/metrics, see how they use the system)
* Don't blindly use any technique, make sure it's a good fit
