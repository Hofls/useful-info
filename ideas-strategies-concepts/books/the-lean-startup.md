### TLDR
* The lean startup - find out what your customers actually want, deliver exactly that

### Definitions
* `Lean thinking` - reduce and eliminate waste (anything that doesn't add value)
* `Validated learning` - set a goal, set metrics that represent the goal, act to achieve the goal, analyze metrics, try again
* Other definitions: `A/B Testing`, `MVP`

### Ideas
* Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer, anything else is waste
* Build-measure-learn loop: instead of making a lot of assumptions, make a lot of adjustments
* Metrics should be: 
    * Actionable (clear cause and effect), 
    * Accessible (everybody should understand it)
    * Auditable (easy to see how its calculated)
* Big picture:
    * Vision (doesn't change)
    * Strategy (may sometimes pivot)
    * Product (changes frequently)
* Customers don't know what they want. They reveal the truth through their action or inaction
* Look at data, test and validate every assumption
