* `Don't Make Me Think` - great UX/UI is simple, with patterns familiar to user (don't invent your own thing)
* `The Phoenix Project` - devops, theory of constraints, kaizen, kanban
* `First Things First` - order of tasks should be based on priorities (e.g. critical -> high -> medium -> low)
* `The 80/20 Principle` - 20% of efforts produce 80% of results
* `Everybody lies: Big data` - to find truth - look at the actions, not words
* `The Unicorn Project` - devops transformation of an entire company
* `Hooked` - to build an addictive product - create a cycle (trigger -> action -> variable reward -> investment)
