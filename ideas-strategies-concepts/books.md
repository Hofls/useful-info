#### TLDR
* `Turn the ship around` - replace `leader-follower` approach with `leader-leader`, by giving out power and control
* `Don't Make Me Think` - great UX/UI is simple, with patterns familiar to user (don't invent your own thing)
* `First Things First` - order of tasks should be based on priorities (e.g. critical -> high -> medium -> low)
* `The 80/20 Principle` - 20% of efforts produce 80% of results
* `Everybody lies: Big data` - to find truth - look at the actions, not words
* `Why people believe weird things` - list of fallacies, biases, cognitive distortions
* `Antifragile` - explores systems that improve when exposed to disorder/stress/volatility
* `Fooled by randomness` - fallibility of human knowledge. People look for explanations even if event was completely random
* `Skin in the game` - if you have the rewards, you must also be exposed to the risks
* `The black swan` - very rare events with big impact. Be ready for them
