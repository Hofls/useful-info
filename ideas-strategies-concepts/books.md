* `Turn the ship around` - replace `leader-follower` approach with `leader-leader`, by giving out power and control
* `Don't Make Me Think` - great UX/UI is simple, with patterns familiar to user (don't invent you own thing)
* `The Phoenix Project` - devops, theory of constraints, kaizen, kanban
* `First Things First` - order of tasks should be based on priorities (e.g. critical -> high -> medium -> low)
