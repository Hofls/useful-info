# List of ideas/strategies/concepts easily applicable in practice:

* `Back-of-the-envelope calculation`- rough calculation with simplified assumptions
* `Fermi estimations` - good approximate calculations with little or no actual data (by making justified guesses)
* `Proof of Concept` - small test which shows if theoretical idea can be achieved in reality
* `SWOT analysis` - helps to identify the most important parameters - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
* `Tit for tat` -  strategy in which agent's first move is cooperation, while all other moves should replicate opponent's previous action
* `Backup` - copy of data stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event
* `Prototype` - early sample, built to test a concept or process
* `Diversification` - don't store all eggs in one basket 
* `Design thinking` - research users => state users needs/problems => generate ideas => create solution prototypes => test solutions
* `Minimum viable product` - version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers
* `Lean methodology` - continuous cycle of improvement (identify problems => plan solutions => implement changes => review results)
* `Occam's Razor` - entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily (simplicity - good, complexity - bad)
* `Pareto Principle` - most things not distributed evenly (20% of the input creates 80% of the result)
* `Diminishing returns` -  the more you increase one single factor, the less results it brings
* `Principle of least effort` - to accomplish a task - the path with the least amount of effort involved will most likely be chosen
* `Trial and error` - repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success
* `Scientific method` - research => hypothesis => experiment => conclusions
* `The Barbell Strategy` - 90% in safety, 10% in risk, 0% in the middle
* `Decomposition ` - break a complex problem/system into parts that are easier to understand
* `Postmortem` - way to document the events that led to the failure and to make sure it wont happen again
* `Antifragile system` - System that gets better when exposed to shocks, disorder, stressors and uncertainty. 
    *  E.g. evolution - system that consists of fragile components, gets better over time because only the most adaptive species survive.
    *  Other examples - poison tolerance, muscle growth, free market, learning from mistakes.
* `Data-driven` - progress in an activity compelled by data, rather than by intuition or by personal experience
    * Also `Metrics driven`, `Facts based`
* `Red team` - group which plays as opposition in simulated situation
* `Reverse engineering` - process of object deconstruction, used to reveal its designs, architecture, code
* `Simulation` - approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system
* `Game theory` - study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers
* `Opportunity cost` - missed benefits when choosing one alternative over another
* `Economy of scale` - cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale
* `OSINT` - open-source intelligence (collecting, analyzing publicly available data)
* `KPI` - performance measurement (e.g. number of bugs, uptime %, time to repair)
* Problem-solving strategies:
    * `Abstraction` - solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
    * `Analogy` - using a solution that solves an analogous problem
    * `Brainstorming` - suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
    * `Divide and conquer` - breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
    * `Hypothesis testing` - assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or disprove) the assumption
    * `Proof` - try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
    * `Reduction` - transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
    * `Research` - employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
    * `Root cause analysis` - identifying the cause of a problem
    * `Trial-and-error` - testing possible solutions until the right one found
    * `Business war games` - players pretend to operate a business, making moves and counter-moves
    * `Thinking outside of the box` - looking for not obvious solutions, questioning assumptions/limitations
* `Shared leadership` - evenly distributes leadership responsibility across team
* `High-performance team` - group highly focused on the goal, achieve superior business results
    * Characteristics: 
        * Participative leadership, Open and clear communications, Valued diversity (of thoughts/experiences)
        * Mutual trust, Managing conflict, Clear goals, Defined roles and responsibilities, Cooperative relationship
        * Positive atmosphere (open, transparent, future-focused)
* `ROWE` - Results Only Work Environment (employees paid for output/results)
    * Employees should understand their role, responsibilities, measurement for success, repercussions of failing
* `Servant leadership` - servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible
* `Learning organization` - facilitates the learning of its members and continuously transforms itself
* `OKR` - Objectives and key results, it's a goal-setting framework
* `Gamification` - add gaming elements to experience in order to motivate/engage users
* `Randomized controlled trial` - randomly divide people into two groups (trial and control)
    * Give real medicine to trial group, fake medicine to control group. Measure and compare results.
* `Anti-pattern` - popular/common solution to a problem that is wrong/ineffective
* `Dark pattern` - typical immoral solution to a problem
* `Consensus` - after discussion, team members arrive to the same conclusion (good alternative to order from a manager; or majority vote)
* `Low-hanging fruit` - Tasks that have the greatest positive effect for the least effort
* `Data science` - extract knowledge from structured/unstructured data
* `Backtesting` - test predictive model on historical data
* `Humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI)` - studies the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people and computers
* `Kaizen` - continuously improve all functions and involve all employees
* `SMART criteria` - to set goals. Goal should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
* `Win-win` - a mutually beneficial outcome. It's often necessary to achieve compromise, put both parties on board and prevent resentment
* `Zero-sum game` - sum of all players points is zero (meaning one player gain is another player loss)
