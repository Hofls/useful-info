#### Indicators
* `Market cap` - Value of all shares (price * count)
* `Ebitda` - Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
    * `Ebitda * (10 or 20 years)` should equal to `Market Cap` (EV/EBITDA multiple)
* `P/E` - (share Price) to (company Earnings per share) ratio
    * Should be `< 40`
    * A lot of growing companies have no earnings, so `P/E` makes no sense

    * Should be `< 20`
* `EPS` - (company Earnings) Per Share
    * Should be `> 10%` per year

* `D/E` - Debt to Equity ratio
    * Should be `< 0.7 (70%)`
