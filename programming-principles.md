* `ACID` - properties of database transactions
    * `Atomicity` - transaction is either succeeds completely, or fails completely
    * `Consistency` - transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another (constraints are satisfied)
    * `Isolation` - concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially
    * `Durability` - once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure
