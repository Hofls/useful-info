* `ACID` - properties of database transactions
    * `Atomicity` - transaction is either succeeds completely, or fails completely
    * `Consistency` - transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another (constraints are satisfied)
    * `Isolation` - concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially
    * `Durability` - once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure
* `Abstraction`:
    * Process of removing details
    * Creation of abstract objects composed from common features/attributes of non-abstract objects.
* `Black box` - system with known input/output and unknown internal workings
* `Code reuse` - usage of existing code to write new code/software
* `Cohesion`:
    * `Low` - class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused
    * `High` - class is focused on one specific task
