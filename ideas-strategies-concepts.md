# List of ideas/strategies/concepts easily applicable in practice:

* 
    * `Back-of-the-envelope calculation`- rough calculation with simplified assumptions
    * `Fermi estimations` - good approximate calculations with little or no actual data (by making justified guesses)
    * `Proof of Concept` - small test that shows if theoretical idea can be achieved in reality
    * `SWOT analysis` - helps to identify the most important parameters - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
    * `Tit for tat` -  strategy in which agent's first move is cooperation, while all other moves should replicate opponent's previous action
    * `Backup` - copy of data stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event
    * `Prototype` - early sample, built to test a concept or process
    * `Design thinking` - research users => state users needs/problems => generate ideas => create solution prototypes => test solutions
    * `Minimum viable product` - version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers
    * `Lean methodology` - continuous cycle of improvement (identify problems => plan solutions => implement changes => review results)
    * `Occam's Razor` - entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily (simplicity - good, complexity - bad)
    * `Pareto Principle` - most things are not distributed evenly (20% of the input creates 80% of the result)
    * `Diminishing returns` -  the more you increase one single factor, the less results it brings
    * `Principle of least effort` - to accomplish a task - the path with the least amount of effort involved will most likely be chosen
    * `Trial and error` - repeated, varied attempts which are continued until success
    * `Scientific method` - research => hypothesis => experiment => conclusions
    * `The Barbell Strategy` - 90% in safety, 10% in risk, 0% in the middle
    * `Decomposition ` - is breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to understand
    * `Postmortem` - way to document the events that led to the failure and to make sure it wont happen again
    * `Antifragile system` - System that gets better when exposed to shocks, disorder, stressors and uncertainty. 
      	E.g. evolution - system that consists of fragile components, gets better over time because only the most adaptive species survive.
      	Other examples - poison tolerance, muscle growth, free market, learning from mistakes.

* Problem-solving strategies:
    * `Abstraction`: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
    * `Analogy`: using a solution that solves an analogous problem
    * `Brainstorming`: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
    * `Divide and conquer`: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
    * `Hypothesis` testing: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
    * `Proof`: try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
    * `Reduction`: transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
    * `Research`: employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
    * `Root cause analysis`: identifying the cause of a problem
    * `Trial-and-error`: testing possible solutions until the right one is found
