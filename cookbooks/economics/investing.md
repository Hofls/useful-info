##### Ideas
* `Diversification` - variety of investments (different countries, sectors, currency...)
    * Always have funds to buy shares during market crash
* Investments should be long term (at least 5 years)
* If stock price falls > 40%, but you still believe in company - consider buying more shares
* Bogleheads:
    * Invest early and often
    * Never bear too much or too little risk
    * Diversify
        * e.g. 66% - index fund/etf/stock; 33% - bonds/cash 
    * Mostly use index funds (but investing in some stocks you like is ok too) 
    * ETFs with their 1% expense ratio is too expensive
    * Optimize taxes

##### Indicators
* `Market cap` - Value of all shares (price * count)
* `Ebitda` - Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
    * `Ebitda * (10 or 20 years)` should equal to `Market Cap` (EV/EBITDA multiple)
* `P/E` - (share Price) to (company Earnings per share) ratio
    * Should be `< 40`
    * A lot of growing companies have no earnings, so `P/E` makes no sense
* `P/S` - (shares Price) to (company Sales) ratio 
    * Should be `< 20`
* `EPS` - (company Earnings) Per Share
    * Should be `> 10%` per year
* `ROE` - Return on Equity
    * Should be `> 20%`
* `ROA` - Return on Assets
    * Should be `> 10%`
* `ROI` - Return on Investment
    * Should be `> 15%`
* `D/E` - Debt to Equity ratio
    * Should be `< 0.7 (70%)`

##### Promising stocks
* You should expect that company in the future will be at better position than it is now
    * e.g. if stock falls 50%, are you sure it will grow back?
* No sharp stock price growth for the last couple of years
    * Stock price should be justified with earnings
* Earnings should be growing each year
* How hard is it for competition to offer a similar product? The harder it is - the better.
    * Creating culinary site is easy, GPU production is hard.
* It shouldn't be too narrow focused
    * E.g. producing one part of a plane
* Stock related to next big thing (e.g. ai, ev, green energy, space, robots...)
* Check for daughter companies (subsidiaries)  
* Finally, look at Indicators (Ebitda, P/S, Debt/Equity...)
