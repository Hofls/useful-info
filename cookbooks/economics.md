### Investments
* `Diversification` - variety of investments (different countries, sectors, currency...)
    * Always have funds to buy shares during market crash
* Investments should be long term (at least 5 years)
* When stock price falls > 40%, it's a great buying opportunity
* Bogleheads:
    * Invest early and often
    * Never bear too much or too little risk
    * Diversify
        * e.g. 66% - index fund/etf/stock; 33% - bonds/cash 
    * Mostly use index funds (but investing in some stocks you like is ok too) 
        * Monitoring individual companies takes too much time. Better invest in an entire industry at once.
    * ETFs with their 1% expense ratio is too expensive
    * Optimize taxes
