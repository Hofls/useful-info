### SRE - Site reliability engineering
* Principles:
    * Cost-effective automation, elimination of repetitive actions
    * Avoidance to pursue more reliability than what's necessary
    * Designing available and efficient systems
    * Observability (ability to answer questions about state of the system)
* Practices:
    * Defining and measuring reliability goals (SLI, SLO)
    * Designing and running an incident management process
    * Capacity planning
    * Chaos engineering
