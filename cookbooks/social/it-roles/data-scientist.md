### Data scientist
* In short - data scientists extracts knowledge from data sets
* Typical steps:
    * Collect data (Instrumentation, logging, sensors, external data, user generated content)
    * Move/Store data (Reliable data flow, infrastructure, pipelines, ETL, data storage)
    * Explore/Transform data (Cleaning, anomaly detection, prep)
    * Aggregate/Label (Analytics, metrics, segments, aggregates, features)
    * Learn (Simple - a/b testing, experimentation, simple ML algorithms)
    * Learn (Hard - AI, deep learning)
    * Measure, improve and optimize
