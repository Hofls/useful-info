### Data scientist
* In short - data scientists extracts knowledge from data sets
* Acquire, clean and process a large amount of data
* Integrate and store data
* Initial data investigation and exploratory data analysis
* Apply data science techniques (e.g. machine learning, statistics)
* Measure and improve results
* Typical steps:
    * Collect (Instrumentation, logging, sensors, external data, user generated content)
    * Move/Store (Reliable data flow, infrastructure, pipelines, ETL, data storage)
    * Explore/Transform (Cleaning, anomaly detection, prep)
    * Aggregate/Label (Analytics, metrics, segments, aggregates, features)
    * Learn/Optimize (Simple - a/b testing, experimentation, simple ML algorithms)
    * Learn/Optimize (Hard - AI, deep learning)
