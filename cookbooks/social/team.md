#### Team. General
* Open and honest `communication` between team members, no toxicity
* Always `move forward`, adapt new technologies and ideas
* Decisions should be made `collectively`, ideas of all members should be heard
* Clear goals, shared mission (no need to top-down management, `no hierarchy`)
* Team is `fully functional`, all the competencies should be within the team
* Everybody `shares responsibility`and collaborates (if somebody stuck, others try to help him)
* `Initiative, opinions, feedback` are encouraged

#### Team. Specifics
* The most important metric - `result` (reaching goals)
* `Bus factor` of anything is more than 1 (easy way is to just write instructions in a wiki)
* If something bad happens - identify root causes to make sure it won't repeat in the future (`Retrospective`)
* Before investing heavily into something - build `cheap prototype`
* Everything should be `reviewed` by at least 1 person (from tech stack decisions, to architecture, to implementation)
* Optimal size `5-10 people`
* Good `risk management`: don't avoid it, have a plan in case things go wrong
* Conflicts resolved by `fact-based arguments`, possibly by reaching compromise

#### Etc
* Each team member should have good [soft-skills](soft-skills.md)
