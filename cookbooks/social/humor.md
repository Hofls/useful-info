##### Humor. General
* Humor:
    * Set expectations (or use existing ones), then break them
    * Often contains ambiguity that leads to an unexpected shift in perspective
* Know your audience - references they understand, views they hold etc
* Deadpan delivery - display of emotional neutrality, to contrast with the ridiculousness of the subject
* Comic timing - give audience time to recognize the joke and react / suspense before delivery of punch line

##### Humor. Methods

    *  Examples:
        ```
        If I don’t have some cake soon, I might die.
        I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.
        ```
* Understatement (Meiosis/Litotes)
    * Examples:
        ```
        *Room is on fire* - This is fine.
        What is this? A school for ants?
        The Troubles - name for decades of violence.
        ```
