#### Agile modeling
* `Documentation`
    * Document continuously
    * Document late (after stable version is ready)
    * Executable specifications - requirements as "customer tests" (instead of static docs)
    * Single-source information (everything stored in one place)
* `Modeling`
    * Active stakeholder participation
    * Architecture envisioning - light-weight modeling to explore the architecture strategy
    * Inclusive tools - simple modeling tools (e.g. whiteboard)
    * Iteration modeling - start with simple model and evolve it
    * Just barely good enough
    * Look-ahead modeling (backlog refinement)
    * Model storming (like brain storming)
    * Multiple models
    * Prioritized requirements
    * Requirements envisioning
