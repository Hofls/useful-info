#### Agile
* `Agile` - team and customers work together to discover requirements and develop solutions
    * Adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, flexible response to changes, continual improvement
* `Product Backlog` - list of ideas and work items 
    * Constantly evolving, consists of (stories, features, bugs, technical debt, improvements), ordered by (ROI, value, risk, complexity, time estimation)
* `Sprint Backlog` - tickets in the sprint (it's a forecast, not a commitment)
    * Owned by developers, flexible
* `Product Increment` - tasks completed in sprint
* `Product Backlog Refinement` - update details/estimates on product backlog items, split them
* `Definition of Done` - acceptance criteria
    * E.g. - coding complete, tests written and pass, code review performed
* `Sprint goals` - sprint objective 
    * E.g. - Implement feedback mechanism. Implement payment integration. Fix all critical bugs.
    * ? IDK, seems too narrow to be useful ?
    
#### Values
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    * E.g. - Fluid communication (when need arises) > Scheduled communication
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
    * Short, concise documentation is enough in most cases
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    * Continuously discover needs of users > Plan everything ahead (contract) 
* Responding to change over following a plan

#### Meetings
* `Sprint Planning` - event where team decides which tasks should be in the sprint backlog
    * Sum of ticket estimations should be equal to sprint capacity
* `Sprint Review` - team and stakeholders inspect the latest increment
    * Demonstrate sprint results, listen for feedback, update product backlog
* `Daily Stand-Up` - meeting to sync up (same time every day)
    * Tell what you did, what you plan to do, is there any impediments?
* `Retrospective` - meeting after each sprint (for continuous improvement)
    * What you like/dislike in the previous sprint, ideas for improvement
    
#### Team
* `Scrum master` - responsible for establishing scrum
    * Manages scrum framework, facilitates events, teaches, removes impediments
* `Product owner` - represents the needs of users and stakeholders
    * Owns product backlog, sets goals, listens to users and stakeholders (e.g. talks, looks at metrics/KPI)
* `Developer` - builds the product
    * Cross-functional, self-organizing, responsible for quality (tests, review, CI/CD, refactoring, automation, architecture)
* `Business analyst` - analyzes the business domain, creates items for backlog
* `Stakeholder` - anybody interested in project success
