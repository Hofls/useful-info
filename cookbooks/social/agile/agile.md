#### Agile
* `Agile` - team and customers work together to discover requirements and develop solutions
    * Adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, flexible response to changes, continual improvement

#### Values
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    * E.g. - Fluid communication (when need arises) > Scheduled communication
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
    * Short, concise documentation is enough in most cases
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    * Continuously discover needs of users > Plan everything ahead (contract) 
* Responding to change over following a plan

#### Principles
* Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
* Welcome changing requirements (even in late development)
* Deliver working software frequently
* Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
* Projects built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
    * IDK, varies from person to person
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
* Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly


#### Practices
* Acceptance test–driven development (`ATDD`)
    * Test format - `Given` balance $18, `When` user tries to withdraw $25, `Then` withdrawal forbidden
* `Agile modeling` - set of best practices for modeling (e.g. creating diagrams)
* `Agile testing` - continuous, involves whole team
* `Backlog (product/sprint)` - tasks (description should be simple)
* `Behavior-driven development` - behavior descriptions (can be automated into tests)
    * Test format - `Given`, `When`, `Then`
* `Continuous integration` - merging all developers work into dev branch daily
* `Cross-functional team` - team of people with different expertise (e.g. developer, analyst, tester)
* `Daily Stand-Up/Scrum` - meeting to sync up (same time every day)
    * Tell what you did, what you plan to do, is there any impediments?
* `Domain-driven design` - code should match business domain
* `Iterative and incremental development` - For each feature: plan -> build -> deliver
* `Pair programming` - one writes code, other observes/reviews
* `Planning poker` - consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating effort
* `Refactoring` - improving structure without changing behavior
* `Retrospective` - meeting after each sprint (for continuous improvement)
    * What you like/dislike in the previous sprint, ideas for improvement
* `Sprint Planning` - event where team decides which tasks should be in the sprint backlog
    * Sum of ticket estimations should be equal to sprint capacity
* `Specification by example` - illustrate requirements using realistic examples
    * Automating tests based on examples
* `Story-driven modeling` - concrete example scenarios
    * Textual scenarios -> GUI mock-ups -> Storyboarding -> Class diagram -> Algorithm design -> Implementation -> Testing 
* `Test-driven development` - tests first, code second
* `Timeboxing` - fixed time period for activity (daily, retro, review etc)
* `User story` - informal, natural language description of a feature (written from user perspective)
* `Velocity` - metric for work done
