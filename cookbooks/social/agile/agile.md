#### Agile
* `Agile` - team and customers work together to discover requirements and develop solutions
    * Adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, flexible response to changes, continual improvement

#### Values
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    * E.g. - Fluid communication (when need arises) > Scheduled communication
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
    * Short, concise documentation is enough in most cases
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    * Continuously discover needs of users > Plan everything ahead (contract) 
* Responding to change over following a plan

#### Principles
    * 
    
#### Practices
* `Sprint Planning` - event where team decides which tasks should be in the sprint backlog
    * Sum of ticket estimations should be equal to sprint capacity
* `Daily Stand-Up` - meeting to sync up (same time every day)
    * Tell what you did, what you plan to do, is there any impediments?
* `Retrospective` - meeting after each sprint (for continuous improvement)
    * What you like/dislike in the previous sprint, ideas for improvement
