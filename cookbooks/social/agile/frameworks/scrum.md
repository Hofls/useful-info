#### Scrum
* `Scrum` - agile framework
* Sprint planning -> Sprint -> Dailies -> Retrospective -> Sprint review

#### Values
* `Focus` - on sprint goals
* `Opennes` - communicate, be transparent
* `Commitment` - do your best to achieve goals
* `Courage` - to do the right thing
* `Respect` - don't be toxic, assume good intentions

#### Workflow
* `Sprint` - time-box during which team creates value (e.g. by developing features)
* `Backlog Refinement` - update details/estimates on product backlog items, split them
* `Sprint Review` - team and stakeholders inspect the latest increment
    * Demonstrate sprint results, listen for feedback, update product backlog
* `Canceling a sprint` - if external circumstances negate value of current sprint - start a new one

#### Artifacts
* `Product Backlog` - list of ideas and work items 
    * Constantly evolving, consists of (stories, features, bugs, technical debt, improvements), ordered by (ROI, value, risk, complexity, time estimation)
* `Sprint Backlog` - tickets in the sprint (it's a forecast, not a commitment)
    * Owned by developers, flexible
* `Product Increment` - tasks completed in sprint
* `Estensions` - help people use scrum
    * `Burndown chart` - chart showing remaining work in a sprint
    * `Release burn-up chart` - track progress toward a release
    * `Definition of ready` - is item ready for development? (e.g. analysis done)
    * `Definition of Done` - acceptance criteria
        * E.g. - coding complete, tests written and pass, code review performed
    * `Velocity` - how much work team can achieve in a sprint
    * `Spike` - period to research a concept or create a prototype
    * `Tracer bullet` - e.g. implement a shot through all layers of an application (e.g. save user input to DB)

#### Team
* `Team`
    * Self-sufficient (doesnâ€™t depend on outsource specialists)
    * Team as a whole accountable for delivery, shared responsibility
* `Scrum master` - responsible for establishing scrum
    * Manages scrum framework, facilitates events, teaches, removes impediments
* `Product owner` - represents the needs of users and stakeholders
    * Owns product backlog, sets goals, listens to users and stakeholders (e.g. talks, looks at metrics/KPI)
* `Developer` - builds the product
    * Cross-functional, self-organizing, responsible for quality (tests, review, CI/CD, refactoring, automation, architecture)
* `Business analyst` - analyzes the business domain, creates items for backlog
* `Stakeholder` - anybody interested in project success
