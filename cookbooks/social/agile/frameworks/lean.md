#### Lean
* `Lean` - agile framework

#### Principles
* `Eliminate waste`
    * `Partially Done Work` - wastes time, reduces codebase maintainability
    * `Extra Processes` - steps that doesn't add value (e.g. documentation that nobody reads)
    * `Extra Features` - low value features (that nobody uses)
    * `Task Switching` - the fastest way to complete two things is to do one at a time
    * `Waiting` - approval delays, impediments
    * `Motion` - time lost moving artifacts/data around or searching for data on wiki
    * `Defects` - cost of fixing defects
* `Amplify learning` - feedback, user needs
* `Decide as late as possible` - try prototypes, gather info 
* `Deliver as fast as possible` - deliver quickly to gather feedback and incorporate it into next iteration
* `Empower the team` - team as a whole should make decisions, brainstorm ideas/solutions, etc
* `Build integrity in` - everything should fit together, work as a whole
* `Optimize the Whole` - don't just optimize a small component, optimize an entire system
