#### Tasks estimation
* First sprint is over. Estimate each task (1 to 21 points), sum all tasks in a sprint, that's how much points you should take in the next sprint.
* If task is too big - better break it down in multiple parts (max should be 13 points)
* Checks if estimations make sense:
    * Story points should reflect time (at least partially)
        * Task with 6 points should take about twice as much time as task with 3 points
    * Sum should work correctly (because we sum all tasks to estimate sprint)
        * Time to do 3 tasks with 2 points should be about the same as 1 task with 6 points
* Provide task examples:
    * 1 point:
        * Add a new parameter to method response
        * Simple refactoring
        * Add an index to table
    * 3 points:
        * Simple REST method
        * Simple bug
    * 5 points:
        * Average REST method
        * Average bug
        * Average refactoring
    * 8 points:
        * Hard bug
        * Hard REST method 
    * 13 points:
        * Multiple interlinked hard bugs 
        * New integration with external system
        * New DB table + multiple average REST methods
    * 21 points:
        * An entire new section in a system
