#### How to find problems:
* Check monitoring
* Check all possible logs
    * Look for errors/successes
* If still not enough info - activate verbose mode
* Try to send requests (CRUD)
* If works partially:
    * Check each node, maybe some of them are malfunctioning
* Create memory dump, analyze it
