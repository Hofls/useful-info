### Glossary
* `Cloud computing` - on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet (e.g. computing power, data storage)
    * The main enabling technology for cloud computing is `virtualization` (separates physical device from virtual devices)
* Types of cloud computing:
    * `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)` - provides servers and storage (usually a VM)
    * `Platform as a Service (PaaS)` - IaaS + installed OS
    * `Software as a Service (SaaS)` - PaaS + hosted apps
    * `Serverless` - servers are abstracted away. Not suitable for complex apps. With lots of functions interacting with one another - complexity grows very quickly.
        * `Function as a Service (FaaS)`
