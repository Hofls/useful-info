#### Introduction
* `Psychology` - study of mind and behavior (to explain, predict and change it)
* `Psychotherapy` - use of psychological methods to help change behavior, increase happiness and overcome problems
* A lot of early psychology ideas turned out to be false (e.g. Freud, Jung, Adler)

#### Psychology types
* `Evolutionary psychology` - seeks to identify which psychological traits are evolved adaptations
    * `Instinct` - innate (built-in) behaviour in response to stimulus
        * E.g. - bird building a nest, dog rolling in a dirt (to camouflage their smell)
    * `Psychological adaptation` - cognitive/behavioral trait that increases chances of survival/reproduction
        * E.g. - humor (shows intelligence to potential mates), waist-to-hip ratio preference
    * `Evolutionary mismatch` - evolved traits that were once advantageous but became maladaptive due to changes in the environment
        * `Obesity and diabetes` - storing energy as fat helped to survive famines back in the day. Now it leads to health problems.
        * `Osteoporosis` - bone mass is dynamic, it was helpful for a lot of physical activity. Now leads to low bones density.
        * `Hygiene hypothesis` - immune system got used to fight a lot of antigens. Now lack of antigens leads to allergies/autoimmune diseases
        * `Dopamine reward system` - brain programmed to continually seek pleasure, it was beneficial for survival and reproductive success
            * Now certain activities (gambling, drug use, eating, entertainment industry) exploit this system, leading to addictive behaviors
