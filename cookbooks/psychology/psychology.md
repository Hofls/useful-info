## Introduction
* `Psychology` - study of mind and behavior (to explain, predict and change it)
* `Psychotherapy` - use of psychological methods to help change behavior, increase happiness and overcome problems
* A lot of early psychology ideas turned out to be false (e.g. Freud, Jung, Adler)

## Psychology types
#### Evolutionary psychology
* `Evolutionary psychology` - seeks to identify which psychological traits are evolved adaptations
* `Instinct` - innate (built-in) behaviour in response to stimulus
    * E.g. - bird building a nest, dog rolling in a dirt (to camouflage their smell)
* `Psychological adaptation` - cognitive/behavioral trait that increases chances of survival/reproduction
    * E.g. - humor (shows intelligence to potential mates), waist-to-hip ratio preference
* `Evolutionary mismatch` - evolved traits that were once advantageous but became maladaptive due to changes in the environment
    * `Obesity and diabetes` - storing energy as fat helped to survive famines back in the day. Now it leads to health problems.
    * `Osteoporosis` - bone mass is dynamic, it was helpful for a lot of physical activity. Now leads to low bones density.
    * `Hygiene hypothesis` - immune system got used to fight a lot of antigens. Now lack of antigens leads to allergies/autoimmune diseases
    * `Dopamine reward system` - brain programmed to continually seek pleasure, it was beneficial for survival and reproductive success
        * Now certain activities (gambling, drug use, eating, entertainment industry) exploit this system, leading to addictive behaviors
    * `Anxiety` - used to be a reaction to solve short-term problems/threats (e.g. run away from a predator)
        * Now most problems are long term, long anxiety causes physical/mental health problems
    * `Cognition` - people may identify patterns in random sequences
* `Sleep` - evolved to conserve energy at night (when activity would be less fruitful, more dangerous) 
* `Sensation/Perception` - gathers information about world, helps guide action
* `Learning/Conditioning` - evolved to solve problems about causal relationships
* `Self-esteem` - self estimate of one's status in the group
* `Mate seleciton` - necessary for high quality offspring 
    * Males look for facial symmetry, femininity, physical beauty, waistâ€“hip ratio, large breasts and youth
    * Females look for resources, rank/social standing, physical beauty
* `Cinderella effect` - stepchildren have higher probability of being abused/neglected
    * Because they don't have genes of their parents, subconsciously parents will invest more into their own biological children
* Benefits granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age (especially past child bearing age)
* `Revenge` instincts exist because it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation
* `Variability hypothesis` - males have greater variability (e.g. way more people with very low/high IQ)

#### Cognitive psychology
* `Cognitive psychology` - 
* `Cognitive module` - sub-unit that can be used to resolve cognitive tasks
    * Examples - fight or flight, libido, movement, beauty appreciation, hunger
    * Disorders caused by cognitive modules running amok:
        * `Jealously` - triggers aggression towards competitors (evolutionary strategy of safeguarding a mate)
        * `Paranoia` - being excessively suspicious of other people or even situations (linked to human survival traits)
        * `Transference` - e.g. one may be angry at a boss, but take the ange out on family
        * `Schizophrenia` - cognitive modules triggered too often, overwhelming the brain with information

#### Positive psychology
* `Positive psychology` - focuses on positive aspects of mind (well-being, happiness, virtues)
* `Eudaimonia` - state of happiness/welfare. Consists of:
    * Self-discovery, development of best potentials, sense of purpose/meaning in life
    * Investment of significant effort in pursuit of excellence, intense involvement in activities
* `Personal development` - activities that develop a person's capabilities, potential, human capital. Consists of:
    * Improving self-awareness/self-knowledge, learning new skills, building self-esteem, improving a career
    * Enhancing quality of life, wealth, social status, improving social relations or emotional intelligence
* `Broaden-and-build theory` - positive emotions broaden awareness and encourage novel/exploratory thoughts and actions
    * Positive emotions have no immediate survival value, but over time enhance survival
    * Negative emotions prompt narrow, survival-oriented behaviors, to deal with immediate danger
* `Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being` - factors which contribute to well-being, contentment, and happiness
    * `Autonomy` - independence, behavior not influenced by social pressure
    * `Environmental mastery` - effective use of opportunities, creating beneficial situations, managing everyday affairs
    * `Personal growth` - continuous improvement, welcoming new experiences 
    * `Positive social relations` - reciprocal empathy, intimacy, and affection
    * `Purpose in Life` - strong goal orientation
    * `Self-Acceptance` - honest and positive attitude about self
