### Graphic design
* `Graphic design` - uses visuals to convey a message
* Keep it simple. Too much stuff becomes overwhelming for a viewer


##### Fundamentals
* `Line` - shape that connects two or more points
    * Usage:
        * Add emphasis to a word (underscore)
        * Divide or organize content (left side | right side)
        * Guide the viewer (arrows on a schema)
    * Attributes:
        * Weight (e.g. thin - less important, thick - more important)
        * Color (e.g. green - OK, red - FAIL)
        * Texture (e.g. solid - formal, patch - informal)
        * Style (straight / curvy)
* `Shape` - 2D area with a boundary (e.g. square, heart, star...)
    * Usage:
        * Organize/Separate content (e.g. left half - yellow rectangle, right half - grey)
        * Simple illustrations (e.g. rectangle cup with square ice and circle lemon)
        * 
* `Form` - 3D shape (even illusion of depth is enough)
    * Usage:
        * Light, shadow and perspective contribute to realism
        * 
* `Texture` - physical quality of a surface
    * Usage:
        * Adds depth and tactility to otherwise flat images
        * Great background images
        * Can be smooth, rough, hard or soft
* `Balance` - equal distribution of visual weight
    * Affected by color, size, number and negative space
    * Symmetrical - similar on both sides (e.g. centered)
    * Asymmetrical - sides are different but have the same weight (e.g. image on the left, text on the right)
