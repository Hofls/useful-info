## Taste
##### Taste structure
* Salty
    * Right amount of salt enhances flavor
    * Low amount of salt = bland taste
    * Table salt (iodized) = good at low temperature. Breaks down at high temperatures (176*), produces weird metallic taste.
    * Kosher salt = good at high temperature
* Sour (acid)
    * Vinegar, Citrus
    * Salad without acid tastes flat
* Fat
    * Butter, oil
    * Food with a high amount of fat tastes good (e.g. fast food)
* Sweet
* Bitter
* Umami (meat)
##### Taste balance
* Complementary (go well together):
    * Salty + Sour (Margarita)
    * Salty + Sweet
    * Bitter + Sweet
    * Sour + Sweet
* If too much of one taste - add complementary one
##### Taste based on
* Aroma (no smell = no taste)
* Balance (too much of one thing is bad)
* Texture
* Temperature
* Presentation - same dish will taste different (depends on how it looks + overall atmosphere)
* Contrast:
    * Aroma (tomatoes and garlic)
    * Texture (soft meat on crunchy bread)
    * Temperature (hot coffee with cold ice cream)
    * Visual (red peppers + green broccoli)
