## Taste
##### Taste structure
* Salty
    * Right amount of salt enhances flavor
    * Low amount of salt = bland taste
    * Table salt (iodized) = good at low temperature. Breaks down at high temperatures (176*), produces weird metallic taste.
    * Kosher salt = good at high temperature
* Sour (acid)
    * Vinegar, Citrus
    * Salad without acid tastes flat
* Fat
    * Butter, oil
    * Food with a high amount of fat tastes good (e.g. fast food)
* Sweet
    * Right amount of sugar enhances flavor, caramelizes when heated
* Bitter
* Umami (meat)
##### Taste balance
* Complementary (go well together):
    * Salty + Sour (Margarita)
    * Salty + Sweet
    * Bitter + Sweet
    * Sour + Sweet
* If too much of one taste - add complementary one
##### Taste based on
* Aroma (no smell = no taste)
* Balance (too much of one thing is bad)
* Texture
* Temperature
* Presentation - same dish will taste different (depends on how it looks + overall atmosphere)
* Contrast:
    * Aroma (tomatoes and garlic)
    * Texture (soft meat on crunchy bread)
    * Temperature (hot coffee with cold ice cream)
    * Visual (red peppers + green broccoli) 

## Cooking
##### Tips
* Taste food while cooking (to identify any problems with taste, to know when it's done)
* Organize your tools and ingredients before cooking
* Cut the food into uniform pieces (so they cook evenly)
* Almost always rise temperature before adding food (so it won't soak oil, won't lose texture)

* In water:
    * Poaching - occurs between 65 and 85, suitable for a delicate food (eggs, poultry, fish)
    * Simmering - occurs between 85 and 95, most common method of cooking in water (stews, sauces)
    * Boiling - occurs at 100
* Steam:
    * For a delicate food (vegetables, fish), healthy form of cooking
* Braise:
    * Turns tough meat into a tender dish
* Saute:
    * Small pieces of food on a high heat, using oil/butter
* Pan-fry:
    * Large pieces of food on a medium-high heat, using oil
* Shallow-fry:
    * Same as pan-fry, except with a high amount of oil (oil should cover about 50% of food height)
* Deep-fry:
    * Same as shallow-fry, except oil fully covers food
* Stir-fry:
    * It's basically saute in a wok
* Roast:
    * In the oven (large cuts of meat, hardy veggies)
