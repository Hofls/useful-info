        Brute Force Attack.
        Consists of an attacker submitting many login-password pairs with the hope of eventually guessing one correctly.
        Usually involves multiple proxies and dictionary of leaked passwords.
        Fix 1: captcha after couple of failed login attempts.
        Fix 2: avoid this attack completely by using OAUTH.
