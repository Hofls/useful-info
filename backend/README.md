* Good:
  * `Rust` - Modern replacement for C/C++, for low level projects
  * `Golang` - Like Rust, but higher level of abstraction
  * `Node.js` - Your frontend developers can develop backend now
  * `Python` - For AI, computer science, small-medium scripts (bash replacement)
  * `TypeScript` - JavaScript for big projects
  * `C#` - Java but from Microsoft 
* Mid:
  * `Kotlin` - Cool Java (android/backend development)
  * `Swift` - Apple walled garden
  * `Dart` - TypeScript/JavaScript but without legacy (not very popular)
