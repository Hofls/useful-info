# List of ideas/strategies/concepts easily applicable in practice:

* 
    * `Back-of-the-envelope calculation`- rough calculation with simplified assumptions
    * `Fermi estimations` - good approximate calculations with little or no actual data (by making justified guesses)
    * `Proof of Concept` - small test that shows if theoretical idea can be achieved in reality
    * `Think outside of the box` - looking for not obvious solutions, questioning assumptions/limitations
    * `SWOT analysis` - helps to identify the most important parameters - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
    * `Hedonic treadmill` - tendency of humans to return to base level of happiness despite major positive or negative life changes
    * `Tit for tat` -  strategy in which agent's first move is cooperation, while all other moves should replicate opponent's previous action

* Problem-solving strategies:
    * `Abstraction`: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
    * `Analogy`: using a solution that solves an analogous problem
    * `Brainstorming`: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
    * `Divide and conquer`: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
    * `Hypothesis` testing: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
    * `Proof`: try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
    * `Reduction`: transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
    * `Research`: employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
    * `Root cause analysis`: identifying the cause of a problem
    * `Trial-and-error`: testing possible solutions until the right one is found
