### Use cases
* Server with installed OS, most generic solution. When no other AWS service fits your needs.

### Usable features:
* `Networking` - expose ports to the internet
* `DNS name` - IP address changes, DNS name stays the same
    * One step away from https (look at `devops` repository)
* `Nested virtualization` - run VM inside VM (e.g. Android emulator)
    * Pick VM size Dv3 or Ev3 (e.g. D2s_v3)
