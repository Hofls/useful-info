#### Definition
`Well-Architected Frameworkâ€™s five pillars` - design principles and best practices

#### The Five Pillars:
* `Operational Excellence` - continuously improve your ability to run systems, create better procedures, and gain insights
    * Based on automation, because human error is the primary cause of incidents
    * `IaC` (Infrastructure as Code) - infrastructure management via configuration files
    * `Observability`- process of measuring the internal state of your system. It allows to track the impact of automation and continuously improve it
        * `Collection` - aggregation of metrics (Infrastructure/Application/Account)
        * `Analytics` - find answers in data (most popular X, how many users did Y, users quit using app after Z happened)
        * `Action` - monitoring & alarming, dashboards, data-driven decisions
* `Security` - all application components and services are considered discrete and potentially malicious entities (zero trust model)
    * `IAM` (Identity and Access Management)
    * `Network Security`
    * `Data Encryption` - encrypting our data everywhere, both in transit and at rest
* `Reliability` - build services that are resilient to service and infrastructure disruptions
    * Techniques to deal with the failure when it happens:
        * `Fault Isolation` - limits the blast radius of an incident by using redundant independent components
        * `Limits` (Service Quotas) - protect services from excessive load (e.g. software misconfiguration, DDoS)
* `Performance Efficiency` - run services efficiently and scalably in the cloud
    * `Cattle model` - every server is interchangeable and quick to deploy, we can quickly scale our capacity by adding more servers
        * As opposed to old `pet model`, where each server is unique
    * `Selection` - picking right tool(service) for the job
        * Type of service:
            * Compute, e.g. VM vs Containers vs Serverless
            * Storage, e.g. S3 vs EBS vs Glacier
            * Database, e.g. Relational vs Non-relational vs Data Warehouse
        * Degree of Management:
            * More opinionated service = More managed experience = Higher level of abstraction
            * If you picked Compute with VM type - EC2 vs Beanstalk vs Lightsail
            * If you picked relation database - RDS vs Aurora 
    * `Scaling` - system's ability to handle more users/requests/load
        * `Vertical Scaling` - moving to a bigger instance type (t3.small => t3.large))
            * Disadvantages - single point of failure, low upper limit
        * `Horizontal Scaling` - increasing the number of instances
            * Disadvantages - Complexity. You need a proxy service to route traffic to services, perform health checks to take bad instances out
* `Cost optimization` - you should provision just enough resources to run everything, and not more 
    * `Pay For Use`
        * `Right Sizing` - matching the service provisioning and configuration to your workload (e.g. choosing small EC2 instance)
        * `Serverless` - you only pay when code is executing (e.g. using Lambda)
        * `EC2 Spot Instances`
    * `Cost Optimization Lifecycle` - continuous process of improving your cloud spend over time
        * Review - Understand where spend is coming from `AWS Cost Explorer` / `AWS Cost & Usage Report`
        * Track - Use `Cost Allocation Tags` (e.g. owner, test/prod, application)
        * Optimize - look at `Pay For Use`
