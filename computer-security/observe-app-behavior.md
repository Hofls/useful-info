### Want to see what's program doing?
* If it is an untrusted app - run it in `Sandboxie` / `Windows Sandbox` / `VMware Workstation Player`
* Run it in `Sandboxie` to observe overall file/registry changes (Sandbox -> R click -> Box Content)
* `Process Mintor` to observe current program activity (network, files, registry, process tree)
* `Ghidra` - TODO
