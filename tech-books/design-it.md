### TLDR
* `Design It!` - Upgrade from programmer to architect
* Architect responsibilities:
  * Work with stakeholders (e.g. product managers) to define business goals and requirements for the software
  * Design architecture, select technologies
* `Quality attributes` - used to evaluate quality of a system (e.g. accessibility, scalability, simplicity)
* Every decision is a trade-off (e.g. increase complexity to improve performance)
* `Design thinking principles`:
  * Design for humans (stakeholders, developers, users) \
    Respectfully collaborate with people, listen, assume positive intent, use human-centered design methods
  * Ambiguity rule. Preserve ambiguity
  * Redesign rule. All design is redesign
  * Tangibility rule. Make ideas tangible to facilitate communication
