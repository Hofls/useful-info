### TLDR
* The goal - novel about improving processes in production plant

### Ideas
* `Theory of constraints` - identify the biggest bottlenecks and fix them (iterative process)
  * Example - factory produces 100 widgets per hour, painting station can paint only 50 per hour (bottleneck). Fix - build second painting station
* `Local maximum` - max performance with the current paradigm
    * Drastic changes may be necessary to move to the next maximum
* Usually goal of business is to make money (e.g. by increasing productivity / decreasing expenses)
* Track how changes affect metrics (e.g. sales, throughput, costs etc) 
* `Operational Expenses` - production costs should be minimized without compromising quality
* `Management by Objectives` - set clear goals, align peoples incentives towards the goals (e.g. produce more high quality products = get more money)
* `Work-Life Balance` - success in one area can positively influence the other
* Teamwork is very important (within team, between teams, between departments etc)
* `Data-Driven` - analytics and data should guide decisions
* `Feedback` - get opinion of other people (colleagues, customers etc)
