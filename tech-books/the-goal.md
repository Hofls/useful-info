### TLDR
* The goal - novel about improving processes in production plant

### Definitions
* `Theory of constraints` - identify the biggest bottlenecks and fix them (iterative process)
* `Local maximum` - max performance with the current paradigm
    * Drastic changes may be necessary to move to the next maximum
* Other definitions - `Bottleneck`

### Ideas
* Usually goal is to make money (e.g. by increasing productivity / decreasing expenses)
* Track how changes affect metrics (e.g. sales, throughput, costs etc)
