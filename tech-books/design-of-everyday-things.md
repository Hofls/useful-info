### TLDR
* Design of everyday things - product design, user experience and human-computer interaction

### Definitions
* `Affordances` - ways in which an object's physical characteristics communicate its function to the user
* `Feedback` - information a product provides to the user about the results of their actions
* `Constraints` - limitations and boundaries that guide user behavior
* `Signifiers` - elements that indicate the function of a product or control
* `Discoverability` - ease with which a user can learn how to use a product
* `Feature creep` - product keeps adding new features, which leads to high complexity
* `Mental workload` - the cognitive effort required to use a product
  * Reducing mental workload enhances usability and allows users to focus on tasks rather than struggling with the interface
* `Natural mapping` - aligning controls with natural, intuitive actions
  * e.g. stove controls placed directly in front of corresponding burners
* `Signaling` - using cues to guide users toward the correct actions or choices
  * This includes everything from color-coding buttons to using icons or labels that suggest what an object does

### Ideas
* It's important to forgive user errors
