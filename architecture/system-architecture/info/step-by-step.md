### How to design a system. Step by step guide
* Requirements clarification (e.g. info about app features, users)
* Back-of-the-envelope estimation (scale, storage, bandwidth)
* Research and analyze existing systems
* Rough API definition 
* Approximate data model (tables and columns)
* High level design (e.g. load balancer, microservices, db)
* Detailed design (data partitioning, cache, replication)
* Identifying and resolving bottlenecks (e.g. single point of failure)
* Security (e.g. https, ddos protection, vulnerability scanning) 
* Continuously monitor and improve the system
