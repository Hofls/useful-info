### Other architecture styles
* `Peer-to-peer` / `P2P` - peers communicate and share resources directly with one another
  * Decentralized, each peer acts as a client and server at the same time
  * Examples - BitTorrent, Bitcoin
* `Service-Oriented Architecture`/`(SOA)` - similar to microservices, but scope is way bigger
  * Microservices are about 1 app/system, while SOA is about integration of different apps/systems
  * SOA usually has central messaging system, e.g. Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
* `Microkernel` - small core with essential functions, all other functions are plugins
* `Broker architecture` - central broker manages communication between services
* `Pipes and Filters` - 
  * Filters process input and produce output
  * Pipes responsible for data flow between filters
* `Zero trust architecture` - every request is authenticated, authorized, and validated
