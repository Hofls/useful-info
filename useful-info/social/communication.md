* Be polite:
	* I think / I propose / What about
	* Good job, but there is room for improvement
	* Ð¡an you look at this feature please?
	* I agree, but there is one little detail
	* Did I get it right?
* Don't attack (it's toxic, puts people on defensive position):
    * Bad - You did a bad job / Its wrong / You made a mistake / It makes no sense
    * Good - Are you sure its correct? / I think we need to improve code quality / Please help me understand it
* Key to persuasion:
    * People should arrive to conclusions on their own, the only thing you can do is to present facts or use socratic questioning
