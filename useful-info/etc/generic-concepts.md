# List of ideas/strategies/concepts easily applicable in practice:

* `Back-of-the-envelope calculation`- rough calculation with simplified assumptions
* `Fermi estimations` - good approximate calculations with little or no actual data (by making justified guesses)
* `Proof of Concept` - small test which shows if theoretical idea can be achieved in reality
* `SWOT analysis` - helps to identify the most important parameters - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
* `Tit for tat` -  strategy in which agent's first move is cooperation, while all other moves should replicate opponent's previous action
* `Backup` - copy of data stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event
* `Prototype` - early sample, built to test a concept or process
* `Diversification` - don't store all eggs in one basket 
* `Design thinking` - research users => state users needs/problems => generate ideas => create solution prototypes => test solutions
* `Minimum viable product` - version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers
* `Lean methodology` - continuous cycle of improvement (identify problems => plan solutions => implement changes => review results)
* `Occam's Razor` - entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily (simplicity - good, complexity - bad)
* `Pareto Principle` - most things not distributed evenly (20% of the input creates 80% of the result)
* `Diminishing returns` -  the more you increase one single factor, the less results it brings
* `Principle of least effort` - to accomplish a task - the path with the least amount of effort involved will most likely be chosen

* `Economy of scale` - cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale
* `OSINT` - open-source intelligence (collecting, analyzing publicly available data)
* `KPI` - performance measurement (e.g. number of bugs, uptime %, time to repair)
* Problem-solving strategies:
    * `Abstraction` - solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
    * `Analogy` - using a solution that solves an analogous problem
    * `Brainstorming` - suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
    * `Divide and conquer` - breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
    * `Hypothesis testing` - assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or disprove) the assumption
    * `Proof` - try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
    * `Reduction` - transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
    * `Research` - employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
    * `Root cause analysis` - identifying the cause of a problem
    * `Trial-and-error` - testing possible solutions until the right one found
    * `Business war games` - players pretend to operate a business, making moves and counter-moves
    * `Thinking outside of the box` - looking for not obvious solutions, questioning assumptions/limitations
* `Shared leadership` - evenly distributes leadership responsibility across team
* `High-performance team` - group highly focused on the goal, achieve superior business results
    * Characteristics: 
        * Participative leadership, Open and clear communications, Valued diversity (of thoughts/experiences)
        * Mutual trust, Managing conflict, Clear goals, Defined roles and responsibilities, Cooperative relationship
        * Positive atmosphere (open, transparent, future-focused)
* `ROWE` - Results Only Work Environment (employees paid for output/results)
    * Employees should understand their role, responsibilities, measurement for success, repercussions of failing
* `Servant leadership` - servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible
* `Learning organization` - facilitates the learning of its members and continuously transforms itself
* `OKR` - Objectives and key results, a goal-setting framework
* `Gamification` - add gaming elements to experience in order to motivate/engage users
* `Randomized controlled trial` - randomly divide people into two groups (trial and control)
    * Give real medicine to trial group, fake medicine to control group. Measure and compare results.
* `Anti-pattern` - popular/common solution to a problem that is wrong/ineffective
* `Dark pattern` - typical immoral solution to a problem
* `Consensus` - after discussion, team members arrive to the same conclusion (good alternative to order from a manager; or majority vote)
* `Low-hanging fruit` - Tasks that have the greatest positive effect for the least effort
* `Data science` - extract knowledge from structured/unstructured data
* `Backtesting` - test predictive model on historical data
* `HCI` - Human–computer interaction, studies the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people and computers
* `Kaizen` - continuously improve all functions and involve all employees
* `SMART criteria` - to set goals. Goal should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
* `Win-win` - a mutually beneficial outcome. It's often necessary to achieve compromise, put both parties on board and prevent resentment
* `Zero-sum game` - sum of all players points is zero (meaning one player gain is another player loss)
* `Nudge theory` - proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior of people
* `JIT learning` (Just-in-time) - learn a new concept only if there is a need to use it. No need? No learning.
    * It's opposite of school/university, where you learn a lot of stuff, without using it to solve real problems
* `Cost–benefit analysis` - systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives
* `Shirky Principle` - Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution
* `Galls law` - A complex system that works is usually have evolved from a simple system that worked
* `SCAMPER` - Technique for brainstorming / thinking outside the box
    * Substitute (analogy), Combine, Adjust, Modify/Magnify/Minify, Put to other uses (generate/connect), Eliminate, Reverse/Rearrange
* `Bikeshedding` or `Law of triviality` - tendency to give disproportionate weight to trivial issues
* `Yak Shaving` - getting sidetracked by multiple different tasks
* `Cognitive load` - how much a person needs to think in order to complete a task
* `Diagram` - visual (symbolic) representation of information
* `Hard data` - measurable and verifiable information
* `Pattern` - typical solution to a specific problem
* `Force multiplier` - anything that dramatically improves the productivity of a team
  * E.g. good tech lead, right incentives, automation
* `Individual contributor` - employee without management responsibilities (e.g. researcher, analyst, developer)
* `Personal networking` / `Business networking` - practice of building/maintaining mutually beneficial connections
* `Audit` - systematic evaluation, often done by 3rd party (e.g. adherence to laws, operational efficiency, security assessment)
* `Dogfooding` - using one's own products or services (allows to look at system from user's perspective)
* `Incentive` - reward/punishment that motivates specific actions and leads to a desired outcome
* `Second order effect` - not obvious consequences of an action
  * E.g. Patient takes antibiotics, 1st order kills off weak bacteria, 2nd order breeds resistant bacteria
* `Conflict resolution` methods - Cooperation (Win-Win), Compromise (No winners/losers), Competition (Win-Lose), Accommodation(Win-Lose), Avoidance(No resolution)
* `BATNA` - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (plan B, if deal fails)
  * Only accept a deal if it's better than your BATNA (don't reveal it directly)
