### 
* `Exponentiation`
    * `10^3 = 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000`
* `Logarithm` - inverse function to exponentiation `10^2 = 100`; `log 100 = 2`
* `Square root`
    * `sqrt(16) = 4 (because 4^2 = 16)`
    * Limits search space when looking for factors of a number
* `Remainder` / `Mod`
    * `if (n % k == 0)` then `n` is an exact multiple of `k`
    * Converts any number to number within borders `index = hashcode % array.getLength()`
* `Factorial` - number of ways to arrange n objects
    * e.g. letters `qwe` can be arranged `3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 times` (`qwe, qew, ewq, eqw, wqe, weq`)

### Areas:
* `Combinatorics`
    * Number of ways that particular event can occur
    * Total number of possible outcomes
    * E.g. - You have endless supply of 10 different ingredients, how many unique dishes you can create?
* `Set theory` studies collections of objects
    * Union, intersection, difference, product of sets
    * E.g. - In a class of 50 students, 15 like music and 10 like art. 5 like both. How many like either of them and how many like neither?
* `Probability theory`
    * E.g. - A bag contains 10 red marbles, 8 blue marbles and 2 yellow marbles. What is the probability of getting a blue marble?
* `Graph theory` studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model relations between objects
    * E.g. - Find the shortest path from node A to node E
* `Statistics` studies methodologies to gather, review, analyze and draw conclusions from data
    * Mean, median, Mode, deviation, correlation, distribution
* `Linear algebra`
