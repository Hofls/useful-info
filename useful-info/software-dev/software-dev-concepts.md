### Main
* `Redundancy/Failover` - multiple copies of service/db (if main fails, switch to standby/replica)
* Thoughtworks `core values`: fast feedback, simplicity, clean code, repeatability (automation)
* `Canary release` - make new features available to a limited selection of users (to reduce risk, gather metrics)
* `Expand and contract` - implement breaking change in API by adding new element, wait for clients to migrate from old to new, remove old element
* `Strangler fig` - bunch of small `Expand and contract`, aimed to replace an entire legacy system
* `Cargo cult` - development characterized by rituals that serve no real purpose
* `MVP` - minimum viable product
* `Template` / `Scaffolding` / `Skeleton` / - basic/minimal project structure
* `Blue-green deployment` - two prod environments, release updates only one (if something goes wrong - you can easily rollback to another one)
* `Opinionated system` - provides one easy way of doing things (way chosen based on opinion of system's authors)
* `Deep modules` - individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work, but with simple interface
* `Infrastructure as code (IaC)` - managing IT infrastructure using configuration files (e.g. provisioning VMs in cloud)
* `A/B testing` - testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective
* `Chaos engineering` - causing failure of system components in production, in order to build resilient system:
  * `Chaos Monkey` - shuts down random servers
  * `Latency Monkey` - introduces communication delays
* `Twelve factor app` - methodology for building SAAS
    * `Codebase` - one codebase, many deployments (dev/stage/prod)
    * `Dependencies` - all dependencies should be explicit
    * `Config` - store config in the environment
    * `Backing services` - treat them (e.g. DB, MQ, Cache) as attached resources (URL in config)
    * `Build, release, run` - "must have" pipeline stages
    * `Processes` - apps should be stateless, with state stored in backing service
    * `Port binding` - services should make themselves available to other services by specified ports
    * `Concurrency` - scale horizontally (by launching multiple instances of an app)
    * `Disposability` - fast startup and shutdown
    * `Dev/Prod parity` - keep environments as similar as possible
    * `Logs` - write all logs to stdout (terminal)
    * `Admin Processes` - any admin/maintenance tasks should be a part of the application
* `Abstraction`:
    * Process of removing (hiding) details
    * Creation of abstract objects composed from common features/attributes of non-abstract objects
* `Black box` - system with known input/output and unknown internal workings
* `Code reuse` - usage of existing code to write new code/software
* `Cohesion`:
    * `Low` - class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused
    * `High` - class is focused on one specific task
* `Composition over inheritance` - classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition
    * (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance 
* `Coupling` - degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected they are
  * Usually direct sync communication is considered high coupling (e.g. rest), indirect async is low coupling (e.g. rabbitmq)
* `Defensive programming` - anticipate failures in your code, then add supporting code to detect, isolate, and in some cases, recover from the anticipated failure.
* `Discoverability` - degree of ease with which the user can find all the elements and features of a new system when they first encounter it
* `DRY` - Don't repeat yourself (Every piece of knowledge must have a single representation in the system)
* `Fail-fast` - system which immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure
* `Gall's law` - good complex systems start as good simple systems and gradually evolve 
* `GRASP` - guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes in object-oriented design
    * `Controller` - first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates ("controls") a system operation
        * The controller should delegate the work to other objects
    * `Creator` - creates objects (e.g. Factory pattern)
    * `Indirection` - assigns responsibility of mediation to an intermediate object (e.g. Controller in MVC)
    * `Information expert` - assign responsibility to the class that has the information necessary to fulfill the responsibility
    * `High cohesion`
    * `Low coupling`
    * `Polymorphism` - single interface with multiple implementations
    * `Protected variations` - identify points of likely variation or instability, create a stable interface around them
    * `Pure fabrication` - class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve low coupling, high cohesion, and the reuse potential
        (e.g. Service in DDD)
* `Information hiding (Encapsulation)` - prevents implementation details from being accessible to its clients (details can change without disrupting clients)
* `Modular programming` - separation of code into independent, interchangeable modules, each module contains everything necessary to execute one aspect of functionality:
	* Independent - low coupling, not dependent on different modules
	* Interchangeable - interface with different implementations
* `Scalability` - ability to handle growing amount of work by adding resources to the system
	* `Horizontal` - adding more nodes (computers) to the system
	* `Vertical` - adding more resources (CPU/RAM) to a single node
* `KISS` - simplicity should be a key goal in design, unnecessary complexity should be avoided
* `Separation of concerns` - separation of a program into distinct sections (1 section = 1 concern)
* `Convention over configuration` - paradigm that attempts to decrease number of decision that developer is required to make (sane defaults)
* `SOLID` - principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable:
	* `Single-responsibility` - every module should have one responsibility (e.g. StringUtils, HttpClient, Logger)
	* `Openâ€“closed` - sometimes makes sense to close code for modification, but open for extension (e.g. plugins, inheritance)
	* `Liskov substitution` - child objects should be able to substitute parent object (e.g. inheritance, interface)
	* `Interface segregation` - many small interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
	* `Dependency inversion` - usually dependencies are created directly, e.g. new UserService(); \
	    But sometimes inverse of that is better, e.g. injection via @Autowired UserService
* `Inversion of control` - inverts traditional control flow. 
	* Traditional approach - code explicitly calls constructor of specific implementation (new BoxService())
	* Inverse approach - code describes type, framework provides implementation (@Autowired)
* `Worse is better` - Software that is limited (worse), but simple to use, may be more appealing to the users (better)
	* `Simplicity` - The design must be simple, both in implementation and UX. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design
	    * Simple UX example - TikTok. Just open app and scroll, no other actions are necessary
	* `Correctness` - The design should be correct
	* `Consistency` - The design must not be overly inconsistent
	* `Completeness` - Completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized
* `YAGNI` - implement things when you actually need them, not when you just foresee that you need them

        * `Object-oriented` - based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data + methods (e.g. Java)
    * `Declarative` - programmer declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
        * `Functional` - programs constructed by applying and composing functions (e.g. Haskell)
        * `Dataflow` - models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations (e.g. Tensorflow)

### Others
* Pick the right tool for the job
* Embrace the tools, don't fight them
    * Use library/framework in a default/standard way
* Always look at problems from business POV
    * E.g. software is bloated and built with outdated tech? Only do something about it, if profits outweigh costs
* Take initiative - don't wait to be told, think what needs doing and advocate for it
* Always learn and improve, keep up with times
* If object oriented, put API on a thing instead of elsewhere. Java is worst at this.
    * Bad - two classes Employee (data), EmployeeUtils (behaviour)
    * Good - one class Employee (data + behaviour)
* Design for simple/frequent cases with simple API, make complex/rare cases possible with separate, more complex API
* Bad API creators think in terms of implementation or domain of API. Good API creators think in terms of use of API (from perspective of user)
* Boy scout rule - always try to leave code a bit cleaner than you found it
