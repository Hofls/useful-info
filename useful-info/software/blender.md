# Blender (3D computer graphics)
### Good options
* Each mode has unique tools (on the left side of the screen), increase their width (by dragging) so full name is seen

### Most important basics
* Camera movement
  * Hold Middle mouse button
  * Hold Shift + Middle mouse button
* Modes (`Tab` to switch):
  * Object Mode (Select the entire object)
  * Edit Mode (Select only part of the object: `1` Vertex, `2` Edge, `3` Face)
* Modifications:
  * `G` - grab
  * `S` - scale
  * `R` - rotate
* Other:
  * `Shift+a` - add new object
